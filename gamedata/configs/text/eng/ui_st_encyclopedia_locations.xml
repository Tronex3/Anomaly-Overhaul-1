You'll find a trader in the vaults at the back of the village, next to the army outpost. Don't miss the chance to talk to him. You'd be advised to steer clear of the outpost itself, however. You don't want the soldiers to catch sight of you - most of them shoot first and don't bother asking questions later. Yet, as always, there are some who can be bribed as long as the top brass is looking the other way. Attacking the soldiers is not recommended, unless they pose a direct threat.

			%c[0,56,209,115]Information\n%c[0,170,170,170]The Red Forest is the 10-square-kilometre (4 sq mi) area near the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant. The name "Red Forest" comes from the ginger-brown colour of the pine trees after they died following the absorption of high levels of radiation from the Chernobyl accident. The forest considered as one of the most dangerous areas in the zone due to the high mutated activity.

Whoever gets close to the Brain Scorcher immediately goes insane, turns into a zombie and starts stalking the Zone restlessly. A human shell is all that's left. No-one has ever returned with a sound mind.

A desert oasis of sorts - a place completely devoid of anomalies and mutants. Be sure to check out the 100 Rads bar in the vaults - it's a meeting point for stalkers from all over the Zone. The bar is run by the local trader, so if you're interested in selling or buying wares apart from the local gossip - that's the place to go. North of the bar is the military base, with the Garbage to the south.

			\n%c[0,56,209,115]Information%c[0,170,170,170]
			\nDuring clean-up operations following the initial disaster, much heavy machinery was operated in the vicinity of the reactor, and was primarily used to remove highly radioactive materials.\n
			\nWhilst most of the equipment here was in perfect working order but had no practical way of being decontaminated, much of the rest just simply broke down due to the harsh conditions and was dumped here shortly after.\n
			\nIn the years following the creation of the Zone as we know it today, the area has become plagued by conflict as Duty and Freedom fight over territory, all the while soldiers and bandits encroach from the east and south.\n
			\nDespite being so isolated and difficult to get to, many stalkers have noticed the vehicles here are gradually being stripped bare - with many believing that somebody, perhaps the military, is attempting to salvage the metals and illegally sell them for scrap.

The place is morbid and sodden with death. Great dangers await any adventurous soul foolish enough to get near it. Anyone who dares to go too far goes insane. Zombie drones are rambling around the whole sector, waiting for new victims. If you walk around the lake and past the zombies, you'll end up at the scientists' camp, where the eggheads brought there by choppers are doing some research. You can have a chat with them; they buy artifacts and could even send you on a mission.
