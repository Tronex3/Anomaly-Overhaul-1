			\nThese creatures lack the higher functions of the brain and act solely on residual reflexes and skills, incapable of conscious activity, and having a high threshold for pain.\n
			\nThe mental and physical health of a zombified stalker will gradually deteriorate over time, eventually losing the last of their humanity, and becoming the mutant known as a zombie.\n
			\nUnlike the mutant however, zombified stalkers are capable of using weapons and tools, and are frequently seen working together in groups, or with soldiers of the Monolith.\n
