Attempting to replace one part spends one charge of a belt. set\n4. In case the replacement is successful, this procedure is repeated for all parts in the specified order\n5. In case the part has been damaged, try again if there is a repair kit and any more weapon parts.\n6. All replaced parts are retained until the condition of the weapon is lowered. In this case, to improve the quality, the parts will need to be replaced anew.\n7. When all five parts have been replaced, the quality of the weapon will be changed to the corresponding one.
