		<text>Being caught by surprise in the Zone is one of the worst things that can happen to you. Although the QR-system does not help you prevent such situations, it certainly helps with getting out of danger.

To use it, set it as a hotkey item. Push the hotkey to activate the emergency release that instantly drops your backpack (and everything inside it) to the ground. Your equipped weapon(s), ammunition, armor and armor attachments as well as UPD remain in your possession, so you are ready to fight. You can retrieve your backpack afterwards.\n \n
