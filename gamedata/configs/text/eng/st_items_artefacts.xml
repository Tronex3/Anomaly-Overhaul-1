		<text>A compound of several hollow organic formations, this artefact emits a gaseous substance that can neutralize chemical or toxic particles inside the body without harming it. Apart from that Bubble, however, possesses numerous negative properties. For example, it greatly amplifies the effects of psy-waves as well as fields produced by mutants and anomalies. This disadvantage is not to be taken lightly: some stalkers have reported that psy influence was so potent when in possession of a Bubble that they felt their heads cracking from the inside and the only thing they could do was scream in pain and run as far as they could. The same mechanism seems to be at work in case of electro anomalies: the artefact will conduct electricity and increase amps of electric current. Moreover, many reports by stalkers indicate that Bubble needs a power source to be functional. This power source is the body itself: the artefact drains vitality and willpower from the user, often on such a scale that it induces dizziness and in extreme cases causes the user to faint. The only other positive aspect to this artefact is the fact that it speeds up healing process and closes up wounds, however it is so potent in this regard that its high price on the market and the demand for it are perfectly justified. Radiation output is highest on the artefact radiation scale. WARNING: Because of its organic nature and instability this artefact is well known to spontaneously combust more so than any other organic artefact and for this reason it is advised to abstain from wearing it in the vicinity of a fire or acid anomaly.\n \n

		<text>A reddish formation of compressed fossilized plants, soil and animal debris. Can partially neutralize chemical poisons by absorbing them and reducing overall toxicity level in user's bloodstream. Quite widespread and not very effective as it makes chemical burns fester. It will catch fire when exposed to open flame or even spontaneously combust. Another downside to this artefact is that it will increase the negative effects of psy-waves and is a potent conductor. It also drains energy from user's body. Stone blood will, however, speed up wound recovery due to its organic nature. Radiation output is lowest on the artefact radiation scale.\n \n

		<text>This artefact is formed in anomalous zones with intense thermal activity. Actively consumes excessive heat and remains cool at all times. It will also protect the user against acids found in toxic and chemical anomalies. On the other hand, exposure to such environments makes the artefact increase the corrosivity of acids due to unknown as of now mechanism. For this reason, one is forced to weigh pros and cons of Crystal when in the vicinity of areas of high toxicity. It also acts as a conductor of electricity. Another positive effect possessed by this artefact is that it accelerates clotting if worn close to the body. (Side note: it is not recommended to keep this artefact in your possession for longer periods of time as blood clots can be hazardous to your health.) This artefact is also highly sought for by jewelers outside the Zone as its inner core is not radioactive and considered to be of exceptional beauty if polished and refined. Only the first 1 cm of its outer layer emits radiation. It is, however, highly advised to proceed with caution when planning to bring the artefact to the market as prolonged exposure to even minimal amounts of radioactive materials can result in death of the user. Covered with very hard layer. Relatively heavy due to high density. Radiation output is lowest on the artefact radiation scale.\n \n

		<text>This artefact resembles melted cheese interspersed with sapphire-like stones. Only yellow outer shell of the artefact appears to give off radiation and by careful processing it is possible to extract the non-radioactive blue parts for jewelery and other industrial purposes. This is due to the fact that if cleaned properly and polished, sapphire comparison becomes much more explicit: the stones are as hard and durable as this beautiful gem. This quality of theirs and their appearance make them perfect gemstones and jewelers all over the world strive to have them in stock. The usefulness of the artefact, however, is not limited to its industrial applications. There is scientific evidence suggesting that sapphire-like stones effectively protect from toxicity, whereas the outer shell slightly increases resistance to heat. Due to its density the weight of artefact has increased beyond normal standards, and thus it is one of the heaviest anomalous creations in the Zone. Radiation output is lowest on the artefact radiation scale.\n \n

The artefact is quite popular in the Zone and is valued by its residents and visitors alike for its energizing properties, although it has an adverse effect on the body when used for prolonged periods of time. One should take note, however, that this artefact hinders blood clotting and increases bleeding rate of open wounds.

It provides a high level of psy protection and absorbs electromagnetic interference, acting as a grounding material. When the artefact comes into contact with the body, it will make one feel rejuvenated and thus it increases stamina recovery. This effect has in case of some stalkers induced hyperactivity. One downside of this artefact, however, is that it reduces the number of platelets in blood, thus increasing bleeding rate. Shell is extremely light and very portable.

		<text>Shaped like a DNA helix, Mama's Beads are created in the Burner anomaly. One of their most characteristic features is that they constantly pulsate, generating emissions beneficial to the human body. These emissions increase the metabolism of any living creature, accelerating coagulation and healing of wounds. The mechanism behind the effects of this artefact is still unknown. Mama's Beads also possess potent protective qualities: they are able to shield the body and objects from extreme heat and acids. On the other hand, it should be noted that the presence of this artefact increases the corrosivity of acids, leading to accelerated deterioration of equipment and higher damage to tissues of any living organism. It is thus strongly advised to proceed with caution in acidic as well as in toxic environments when in possession of Mama's Beads. Another dangerous effect of this artefact is the fact that it will increase electrical conductivity, so the probability of electrocution while wearing this artefact is much higher, especially during storms and in the vicinity of electrical anomalies. The weight is also quite high for such a small artefact, which leads to a conclusion that is of extremely high density. Radiation output is low on the artefact radiation scale.\n \n

On the other hand, it is extremely important to note that each time it comes into contact with electricity, it will release a static build-up which, while not deadly, can have an effect similar to a Taser shock. The artefact has weak regenerative properties and its direct touch has similar effect to a plasma globe, making one feel energized.

It can be found most commonly in or near electro anomalies and it seems to have absorbed their certain characteristics: it is able to smooth fluctuations in electric field density and acts as a weak resistor, protecting the wearer from electricity and reducing its damaging effects. When worn, the artefact is also known to slightly counter the harmful effects of psy-anomalies or psy-waves of some mutants. Because of its electrical nature, it provides the body with additional albeit weak source of energy.

		<text>This artefact, which resembles the human eye, considerably increases metabolism of the body, helping wounds heal quicker. Experienced stalkers say that Eye also brings luck. Irrespective of the validity of that statement, its positive effects are indeed quite potent. First of all, it reduces temperature of user's body and cools all objects in its vicinity. Secondly, it provides substantial protection against all types of acids by gradually increasing their pH to the level of water (pH of 7). Thirdly, this artefact soothes the pain and is extremely useful when treating wounds. These beneficial qualities, however, come at a price. This artefact is extremely dangerous when exposed to chemical anomalies as it amplifies their toxicity and increases their potency. It is hence highly recommended to keep the artefact in your backpack, never on the body, when exploring toxic areas unless you have a death wish. The artefact is also known colloquially as "copper eye" as it conducts electricity and amplifies its dangerous effects in the same way as copper does.

		<text>This artefact forms in areas of high thermal activity. Produces powerful infrared emissions which intensify metabolic processes, healing wounds before its bearer's very eyes. As this artefact is very rare, it is extremely valuable. As regards its effects, it is similar to the Eye in that it will reduce the temperature of user's body, which is especially useful when exposed to potent heat sources. It also acts as powerful resistor, and negates the effect of acids. Moreover, its healing capabilities are even stronger than in case of the Eye as stalkers in possession of this artefact are said to have survived being wounded by chimeras. Thanks to that, it has earned the reputation of a miraculous artefact. Many stalkers owe it their lives, and most veteran mutant hunters carry it in case they run into danger. However, it shares not only positive but also negative properties of its cousin: entering a toxic or chemical anomaly with this artefact on the belt is suicide. It will increase the corrosivity of chemical particles and enhance the adverse effect of the toxins within user's bloodstream. It can also be used as a reusable medkit of sorts since it heals wounds very quickly. Radiation output is highest on the artefact radiation scale.\n \n

		<text>It is a spherical artefact made of red-colored crystal, created in the Burner anomaly. It has an unique property - it has a constant temperature of 75 degrees Fahrenheit/24 degrees Celsius, regardless of its surroundings. This allows it to absorb heat from its vicinity and to create a little pocket around the user which prevents the flames from damaging the body. Stability of temperature is the cause of another of its positive effects: it accelerates healing rate and stops bleeding. It will also protect the user from chemical burns. However, it is unrecommended to approach chemical and acid anomalies when in possession of the artefact as it will increase the adverse effects of acids and toxins in user's bloodstream.

		<text>A relatively rare artefact forming in chemical areas, Kolobok is highly valued for its ability to heal most kinds of wounds and stop bleeding in a matter of minutes. For unknown reasons, scientists are spreading rumors among stalkers that the artefact modifies bearer's genetic code, which is unproven and should be regarded as conscious attempt at monopolizing the supply of the artefact by the scientific community. This does not, however, mean that it is completely harmless. One drawback of this artefact is the fact that it will increase electrical conductivity, so it is best to avoid electro anomalies when in possession of the artefact, especially since its negative effects are not balanced with positive ones. It will also reduce energy recovery, which is the result of its sharp needle-like appendages. The needles cause small and quickly healing wounds which bring constant pain and itch, thus reducing stamina. This artefact also weakens protection against psy-emissions produced by anomalies or mutants as well as from heat and acids due to its high flammability. Given its chemical origin, it is also well known for its ability to increase user's protection against toxicity. Lightweight and not too much of a burden to carry around.

		<text>Direct successor to and a superior version of Gravi artefact. As was the case with Gravi, it was scientist Sakharov at Yantar who discovered its unique properties after a massive blowout/emission hit the Zone. Thanks to meticulous research that followed, it was established that this new artefact is produced when three Gravi artefacts interact and get sucked into one another's singularity fields. This phenomenon is extremely rare, due to which the artefact is highly valued. It is rumored within Ukrainian Spetsnaz circles that in the Zone there are agents from the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation whose sole objective is acquiring and transporting Goldfish to specialized laboratories located outside of the Zone. The artefact creates a constant gravitational singularity field which affects only its closest vicinity. However, some stalkers have been known to disappear for no apparent reason leaving only a Goldfish behind. The artefact provides exceptional thermal and acid protection. Furthermore, it also forms a protective and almost greasy film around its user which has qualities of strong fire retardant and also protects the user against acid by breaking down elements comprising acids into simpler substances.

		<text>Gravi is formed from metallic substances exposed to prolonged gravitation. This makes it capable of sustaining a gravitational field, which causes it to have various properties, among others increasing weight of all objects in its close proximity. For a long time, the artefact was a mystery, and it was scientist Sakharov at Yantar who first discovered that Gravi creates a minute singularity field of gravitational nature, the phenomenon which occurs in intervals of 30 minutes. This artefact may yield beneficial results in medicine or warfare if the mechanism behind its functioning is harnessed for the purposes of science. Suffice it to say, its positive properties completely outweigh its negative aspects. Namely, it increases weight of objects as a result of gravitational field and emits lethal doses of radiation. On the other hand, it will protect the user from harmful effects of fire anomalies found throughout the Zone and from acids of chemical/toxic anomalies. However, instead of absorbing deadly chemicals and toxins, Gravi causes chemical compounds to be broken down to simpler substances thanks to its singularity field.

Thanks to its unique properties, the artefact can significantly increase the bearer's muscle tone, thus greatly improving stamina recovery. Due to its high radioactivity, stalkers in possession of it are sometimes jokingly referred to as "Radioactive Snowflakes". When faced with the decision whether to carry it on the belt during a mission, you have to carefully weigh its pros and cons: does it pay to have greater endurance and high protection against electricity at the cost of being constantly exposed to its deadly radiation? Even if you are determined to take it with you, it should be noted that it is not to be used on long excursions to the Zone. Its usefulness in a fight is also debatable as it increases bleeding rate and prevents wounds from closing due to its very sharp appendages which sting the user and irritate the skin.

Firstly, when in the closest proximity of heat source it emits odor of burning flesh. Prolonged exposure may enhance its flammability and cause it to ignite. While this phenomenon leaves the artefact undamaged, it can cause objects in its vicinity to heat up and in extreme cases to ignite along with the artefact. For this reason, it is safe to conclude that it absorbs heat and is able to convey it to other objects. Secondly, to carry the sponge metaphor further, the pores on its surface are known to absorb small amounts of toxicity from environment. Thirdly, the artefact slightly amplifies the damaging effects of psy-fields to living organisms by absorbing psy energy and emitting it at a small rate. Fourthly, Meat Chunk is also known to be a conductor of electricity much like the skin of a living creature. Certain sources within stalker community indicate further that it makes one feel physically drained when used for even short periods of time.

		<text>This bizarrely-shaped artefact appears in places with increased gravitational activity. Acting as a kind of sponge that absorbs chemical and toxic elements, this artefact provides protection from external toxic agents as well as from chemical particles that have already made their way into the body. Although it appears almost organic, it is actually more similar to coral. Due to its non-organic nature, it is nonflammable. It provides protection against acids as well as heat. There is no particular faction that takes great interest in it, so it is mostly sold to scientists who study and experiment on the artefact in order to find the use for it.

It also amplifies the harmful effects of both psy-fields and electro anomalies, and seems to drain stamina and decrease stamina recovery. However, it will absorb any and all deadly chemicals within one's body. Furthermore, it admirably protects against toxicity, and seems to inject neutralizing chemical agents into user's bloodstream, which negate the effects of toxins and nerve damage. For this reason, it is in high demand in military circles as it can make terrorist attacks with chemical or biological weapons more easily manageable. Unfortunately, Firefly is extremely rare.

This makes it capable of sustaining a gravitational field, which causes it to have various properties, among others increasing weight of all objects in its close proximity. For a long time, the artefact was a mystery, and it was scientist Sakharov at Yantar who first discovered that Gravi creates a minute singularity field of gravitational nature, the phenomenon which occurs in intervals of 30 minutes. This artefact may yield beneficial results in medicine or warfare if the mechanism behind its functioning is harnessed for the purposes of science. Suffice it to say, its positive properties completely outweigh its negative aspects. Namely, it increases weight of objects as a result of gravitational field and emits lethal doses of radiation. On the other hand, it will protect the user from harmful effects of fire anomalies found throughout the Zone and from acids of chemical/toxic anomalies. However, instead of absorbing deadly chemicals and toxins, Gravi causes chemical compounds to be broken down to simpler substances thanks to its singularity field. As noted above, it is extremely heavy and it is not recommended to use it on long excursions into the Zone, especially for extended periods of time.

Thanks to meticulous research that followed, it was established that this new artefact is produced when three Gravi artefacts interact and get sucked into one another's singularity fields. This phenomenon is extremely rare, due to which the artefact is highly valued. It is rumored within Ukrainian Spetsnaz circles that in the Zone there are agents from the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation whose sole objective is acquiring and transporting Goldfish to specialized laboratories located outside of the Zone. The artefact creates a constant gravitational singularity field which affects only its closest vicinity. However, some stalkers have been known to disappear for no apparent reason leaving only a Goldfish behind. The artefact provides exceptional thermal and acid protection. Furthermore, it also forms a protective and almost greasy film around its user which has qualities of strong fire retardant and also protects the user against acid by breaking down elements comprising acids into simpler substances.

It is thus strongly advised to proceed with caution in acidic as well as in toxic environments when in possession of "Mama's beads". Another dangerous effect of this artefact is the fact that it will increase electrical conductivity, so the probability of electrocution while wearing this artefact is much higher, especially during storms and in the vicinity of electrical anomalies.

It also acts as powerful resistor, and negates the effect of acids. Moreover, its healing capabilities are even stronger than in case of the Eye as stalkers in possession of this artefact are said to have survived being wounded by chimeras. Thanks to that, it has earned the reputation of a miraculous artefact. Many stalkers owe it their lives, and most veteran mutant hunters carry it in case they run into danger. However, it shares not only positive but also negative properties of its cousin: entering a toxic or chemical anomaly with this artefact on the belt is suicide. It will increase the corrosivity of chemical particles and enhance the adverse effect of the toxins within user's bloodstream. It can also be used as a reusable medkit of sorts since it heals wounds very quickly. Radiation output decreased owing to the container.\n \n

		<text>Meat Chunk in Improvised Application Module. This artefact has soft, porous, skin-like texture and is said to be able to compress. It resembles and acts like a sponge in this regard, but reveals its special characteristics only when exposed to certain external conditions. Firstly, when in the closest proximity of heat source it emits odor of burning flesh. Prolonged exposure may enhance its flammability and cause it to ignite. While this phenomenon leaves the artefact undamaged, it can cause objects in its vicinity to heat up and in extreme cases to ignite along with the artefact. For this reason, it is safe to conclude that it absorbs heat and is able to convey it to other objects. Secondly, to carry the sponge metaphor further, the pores on its surface are known to absorb small amounts of toxicity from environment. Thirdly, the artefact slightly amplifies the damaging effects of psy-fields to living organisms by absorbing psy energy and emitting it at a small rate. Fourthly, Meat Chunk is also known to be a conductor of electricity much like the skin of a living creature. Certain sources within stalker community indicate further that it makes one feel physically drained when used for even short periods of time. Fifthly, probably the most beneficial feature of this artefact is its ability to slowly close up wounds and heal damaged tissues. Radiation output decreased owing to the container.\n \n

For unknown reasons, scientists are spreading rumors among stalkers that the artefact modifies bearer's genetic code, which is unproven and should be regarded as conscious attempt at monopolizing the supply of the artefact by the scientific community. This does not, however, mean that it is completely harmless. One drawback of this artefact is the fact that it will increase electrical conductivity, so it is best to avoid electro anomalies when in possession of the artefact, especially since its negative effects are not balanced with positive ones. It will also reduce energy recovery, which is the result of its sharp needle-like appendages. The needles cause small and quickly healing wounds which bring constant pain and itch, thus reducing stamina. This artefact also weakens protection against psy-emissions produced by anomalies or mutants as well as from heat and acids due to its high flammability. Given its chemical origin, it is also well known for its ability to increase user's protection against toxicity. Lightweight and not too much of a burden to carry around.

A compound of several hollow organic formations, this artefact emits a gaseous substance that can neutralize chemical or toxic particles inside the body without harming it. Apart from that Bubble, however, possesses numerous negative properties. For example, it greatly amplifies the effects of psy-waves as well as fields produced by mutants and anomalies. This disadvantage is not to be taken lightly: some stalkers have reported that psy influence was so potent when in possession of a Bubble that they felt their heads cracking from the inside and the only thing they could do was scream in pain and run as far as they could. The same mechanism seems to be at work in case of electro anomalies: the artefact will conduct electricity and increase amps of electric current. Moreover, many reports by stalkers indicate that Bubble needs a power source to be functional. This power source is the body itself: the artefact drains vitality and willpower from the user, often on such a scale that it induces dizziness and in extreme cases causes the user to faint. The only other positive aspect to this artefact is the fact that it speeds up healing process and closes up wounds, however it is so potent in this regard that its high price on the market and the demand for it are perfectly justified. Radiation output decreased owing to the container. WARNING: Because of its organic nature and instability this artefact is well known to spontaneously combust more so than any other organic artefact and for this reason it is advised to abstain from wearing it in the vicinity of a fire or acid anomaly.\n \n

This artefact may yield beneficial results in medicine or warfare if the mechanism behind its functioning is harnessed for the purposes of science. Suffice it to say, its positive properties completely outweigh its negative aspects. Namely, it increases weight of objects as a result of gravitational field and emits lethal doses of radiation. On the other hand, it will protect the user from harmful effects of fire anomalies found throughout the Zone and from acids of chemical/toxic anomalies. However, instead of absorbing deadly chemicals and toxins, Gravi causes chemical compounds to be broken down to simpler substances thanks to its singularity field.

This phenomenon is extremely rare, due to which the artefact is highly valued. It is rumored within Ukrainian Spetsnaz circles that in the Zone there are agents from the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation whose sole objective is acquiring and transporting Goldfish to specialized laboratories located outside of the Zone. The artefact creates a constant gravitational singularity field which affects only its closest vicinity. However, some stalkers have been known to disappear for no apparent reason leaving only a Goldfish behind. The artefact provides exceptional thermal and acid protection. Furthermore, it also forms a protective and almost greasy film around its user which has qualities of strong fire retardant and also protects the user against acid by breaking down elements comprising acids into simpler substances.

It is thus strongly advised to proceed with caution in acidic as well as in toxic environments when in possession of "Mama's beads". Another dangerous effect of this artefact is the fact that it will increase electrical conductivity, so the probability of electrocution while wearing this artefact is much higher, especially during storms and in the vicinity of electrical anomalies.

		<text>Eye in Artefact Application Container. This artefact, which resembles the human eye, considerably increases metabolism of the body, helping wounds heal quicker. Experienced stalkers say that Eye also brings luck. Irrespective of the validity of that statement, its positive effects are indeed quite potent. First of all, it reduces temperature of user's body and cools all objects in its vicinity. Secondly, it provides substantial protection against all types of acids by gradually increasing their pH to the level of water (pH of 7). Thirdly, this artefact soothes the pain and is extremely useful when treating wounds. These beneficial qualities, however, come at a price. This artefact is extremely dangerous when exposed to chemical anomalies as it amplifies their toxicity and increases their potency. It is hence highly recommended to keep the artefact in your backpack, never on the body, when exploring toxic areas unless you have a death wish. The artefact is also known colloquially as "Copper eye" as it conducts electricity and amplifies its dangerous effects in the same way as copper does.

Produces powerful infrared emissions which intensify metabolic processes, healing wounds before its bearer's very eyes. As this artefact is very rare, it is extremely valuable. As regards its effects, it is similar to the Eye in that it will reduce the temperature of user's body, which is especially useful when exposed to potent heat sources. It also acts as powerful resistor, and negates the effect of acids. Moreover, its healing capabilities are even stronger than in case of the Eye as stalkers in possession of this artefact are said to have survived being wounded by chimeras. Thanks to that, it has earned the reputation of a miraculous artefact. Many stalkers owe it their lives, and most veteran mutant hunters carry it in case they run into danger. However, it shares not only positive but also negative properties of its cousin: entering a toxic or chemical anomaly with this artefact on the belt is suicide. It will increase the corrosivity of chemical particles and enhance the adverse effect of the toxins within user's bloodstream. It can also be used as a reusable medkit of sorts since it heals wounds very quickly. Radiation output decreased owing to the container.\n \n

		<text>Meat Chunk in Artefact Application Container. This artefact has soft, porous, skin-like texture and is said to be able to compress. It resembles and acts like a sponge in this regard, but reveals its special characteristics only when exposed to certain external conditions. Firstly, when in the closest proximity of heat source it emits odor of burning flesh. Prolonged exposure may enhance its flammability and cause it to ignite. While this phenomenon leaves the artefact undamaged, it can cause objects in its vicinity to heat up and in extreme cases to ignite along with the artefact. For this reason, it is safe to conclude that it absorbs heat and is able to convey it to other objects. Secondly, to carry the sponge metaphor further, the pores on its surface are known to absorb small amounts of toxicity from environment. Thirdly, the artefact slightly amplifies the damaging effects of psy-fields to living organisms by absorbing psy energy and emitting it at a small rate. Fourthly, Meat Chunk is also known to be a conductor of electricity much like the skin of a living creature. Certain sources within stalker community indicate further that it makes one feel physically drained when used for even short periods of time. Fifthly, probably the most beneficial feature of this artefact is its ability to slowly close up wounds and heal damaged tissues. Radiation output decreased owing to the container.\n \n

A relatively rare artefact forming in chemical areas, Kolobok is highly valued for its ability to heal most kinds of wounds and stop bleeding in a matter of minutes. For unknown reasons, scientists are spreading rumors among stalkers that the artefact modifies bearer's genetic code, which is unproven and should be regarded as conscious attempt at monopolizing the supply of the artefact by the scientific community. This does not, however, mean that it is completely harmless. One drawback of this artefact is the fact that it will increase electrical conductivity, so it is best to avoid electro anomalies when in possession of the artefact, especially since its negative effects are not balanced with positive ones. It will also reduce energy recovery, which is the result of its sharp needle-like appendages. The needles cause small and quickly healing wounds which bring constant pain and itch, thus reducing stamina. This artefact also weakens protection against psy-emissions produced by anomalies or mutants as well as from heat and acids due to its high flammability. Given its chemical origin, it is also well known for its ability to increase user's protection against toxicity. Lightweight and not too much of a burden to carry around.

A compound of several hollow organic formations, this artefact emits a gaseous substance that can neutralize chemical or toxic particles inside the body without harming it. Apart from that Bubble, however, possesses numerous negative properties. For example, it greatly amplifies the effects of psy-waves as well as fields produced by mutants and anomalies. This disadvantage is not to be taken lightly: some stalkers have reported that psy influence was so potent when in possession of a Bubble that they felt their heads cracking from the inside and the only thing they could do was scream in pain and run as far as they could. The same mechanism seems to be at work in case of electro anomalies: the artefact will conduct electricity and increase amps of electric current. Moreover, many reports by stalkers indicate that Bubble needs a power source to be functional. This power source is the body itself: the artefact drains vitality and willpower from the user, often on such a scale that it induces dizziness and in extreme cases causes the user to faint. The only other positive aspect to this artefact is the fact that it speeds up healing process and closes up wounds, however it is so potent in this regard that its high price on the market and the demand for it are perfectly justified. Radiation output decreased owing to the container. WARNING: Because of its organic nature and instability this artefact is well known to spontaneously combust more so than any other organic artefact and for this reason it is advised to abstain from wearing it in the vicinity of a fire or acid anomaly.\n \n

This strange artefact was considered devoid of any useful properties by many scientists for a long time. Only recently has it been discovered that it is indeed quite beneficial. It provides a high level of psy protection and absorbs electromagnetic interference, acting as a grounding material. When the artefact comes into contact with the body, it will make one feel rejuvenated and thus it increases stamina recovery. This effect has in case of some stalkers induced hyperactivity. One downside of this artefact, however, is that it reduces the number of platelets in blood, thus increasing bleeding rate. Shell is extremely light and very portable.

Some claim that it actually is a form of Kolobok as it greatly increases resistance to electric currents by creating its own electric field and absorbing electricity that passes through user's body. Thanks to its unique properties, the artefact can significantly increase the bearer's muscle tone, thus greatly improving stamina recovery. Due to its high radioactivity, stalkers in possession of it are sometimes jokingly referred to as "Radioactive Snowflakes". When faced with the decision whether to carry it on the belt during a mission, you have to carefully weigh its pros and cons: does it pay to have greater endurance and high protection against electricity at the cost of being constantly exposed to its deadly radiation? Even if you are determined to take it with you, it should be noted that it is not to be used on long excursions to the Zone. Its usefulness in a fight is also debatable as it increases bleeding rate and prevents wounds from closing due to its very sharp appendages which sting the user and irritate the skin. It is, however, as light as a snowflake and very easy to carry around. Radiation output decreased owing to the container.\n \n

It has an unique property - it has a constant temperature of 75 degrees Fahrenheit/24 degrees Celsius, regardless of its surroundings. This allows it to absorb heat from its vicinity and to create a little pocket around the user which prevents the flames from damaging the body. Stability of temperature is the cause of another of its positive effects: it accelerates healing rate and stops bleeding. It will also protect the user from chemical burns. However, it is unrecommended to approach chemical and acid anomalies when in possession of the artefact as it will increase the adverse effects of acids and toxins in user's bloodstream. It also makes the user vulnerable to electrical currents. It is quite heavy due to high density of crystal-like material. Radiation output decreased owing to the container.\n \n

		<text>Mama's Beads in Advanced Application Module. Shaped like a DNA helix, "Mama's beads" are created in the Burner anomaly. One of their most characteristic features is that they constantly pulsate, generating emissions beneficial to the human body. These emissions increase the metabolism of any living creature, accelerating coagulation and healing of wounds. The mechanism behind the effects of this artefact is still unknown. "Mama's beads" also possess potent protective qualities: they are able to shield the body and objects from extreme heat and acids. On the other hand, it should be noted that the presence of this artefact increases the corrosivity of acids, leading to accelerated deterioration of equipment and higher damage to tissues of any living organism. It is thus strongly advised to proceed with caution in acidic as well as in toxic environments when in possession of "Mama's beads". Another dangerous effect of this artefact is the fact that it will increase electrical conductivity, so the probability of electrocution while wearing this artefact is much higher, especially during storms and in the vicinity of electrical anomalies. The weight is also quite high for such a small artefact, which leads to a conclusion that is of extremely high density. Radiation output decreased owing to the container.\n \n

		<text>Eye in Advanced Application Module. This artefact, which resembles the human eye, considerably increases metabolism of the body, helping wounds heal quicker. Experienced stalkers say that Eye also brings luck. Irrespective of the validity of that statement, its positive effects are indeed quite potent. First of all, it reduces temperature of user's body and cools all objects in its vicinity. Secondly, it provides substantial protection against all types of acids by gradually increasing their pH to the level of water (pH of 7). Thirdly, this artefact soothes the pain and is extremely useful when treating wounds. These beneficial qualities, however, come at a price. This artefact is extremely dangerous when exposed to chemical anomalies as it amplifies their toxicity and increases their potency. It is hence highly recommended to keep the artefact in your backpack, never on the body, when exploring toxic areas unless you have a death wish. The artefact is also known colloquially as "Copper eye" as it conducts electricity and amplifies its dangerous effects in the same way as copper does.

Produces powerful infrared emissions which intensify metabolic processes, healing wounds before its bearer's very eyes. As this artefact is very rare, it is extremely valuable. As regards its effects, it is similar to the Eye in that it will reduce the temperature of user's body, which is especially useful when exposed to potent heat sources. It also acts as powerful resistor, and negates the effect of acids. Moreover, its healing capabilities are even stronger than in case of the Eye as stalkers in possession of this artefact are said to have survived being wounded by chimeras. Thanks to that, it has earned the reputation of a miraculous artefact. Many stalkers owe it their lives, and most veteran mutant hunters carry it in case they run into danger. However, it shares not only positive but also negative properties of its cousin: entering a toxic or chemical anomaly with this artefact on the belt is suicide. It will increase the corrosivity of chemical particles and enhance the adverse effect of the toxins within user's bloodstream. It can also be used as a reusable medkit of sorts since it heals wounds very quickly. Radiation output decreased owing to the container.\n \n

		<text>Meat Chunk in Advanced Application Module. This artefact has soft, porous, skin-like texture and is said to be able to compress. It resembles and acts like a sponge in this regard, but reveals its special characteristics only when exposed to certain external conditions. Firstly, when in the closest proximity of heat source it emits odor of burning flesh. Prolonged exposure may enhance its flammability and cause it to ignite. While this phenomenon leaves the artefact undamaged, it can cause objects in its vicinity to heat up and in extreme cases to ignite along with the artefact. For this reason, it is safe to conclude that it absorbs heat and is able to convey it to other objects. Secondly, to carry the sponge metaphor further, the pores on its surface are known to absorb small amounts of toxicity from environment. Thirdly, the artefact slightly amplifies the damaging effects of psy-fields to living organisms by absorbing psy energy and emitting it at a small rate. Fourthly, Meat Chunk is also known to be a conductor of electricity much like the skin of a living creature. Certain sources within stalker community indicate further that it makes one feel physically drained when used for even short periods of time.

One drawback of this artefact is the fact that it will increase electrical conductivity, so it is best to avoid electro anomalies when in possession of the artefact, especially since its negative effects are not balanced with positive ones. It will also reduce energy recovery, which is the result of its sharp needle-like appendages. The needles cause small and quickly healing wounds which bring constant pain and itch, thus reducing stamina.

Some claim that it actually is a form of Kolobok as it greatly increases resistance to electric currents by creating its own electric field and absorbing electricity that passes through user's body. Thanks to its unique properties, the artefact can significantly increase the bearer's muscle tone, thus greatly improving stamina recovery. Due to its high radioactivity, stalkers in possession of it are sometimes jokingly referred to as "Radioactive Snowflakes". When faced with the decision whether to carry it on the belt during a mission, you have to carefully weigh its pros and cons: does it pay to have greater endurance and high protection against electricity at the cost of being constantly exposed to its deadly radiation? Even if you are determined to take it with you, it should be noted that it is not to be used on long excursions to the Zone. Its usefulness in a fight is also debatable as it increases bleeding rate and prevents wounds from closing due to its very sharp appendages which sting the user and irritate the skin. It is, however, as light as a snowflake and very easy to carry around. Radiation output decreased owing to the container.\n \n

		<text>Gravi in Lead-Lined Container. Gravi is formed from metallic substances exposed to prolonged gravitation. This makes it capable of sustaining a gravitational field, which causes it to have various properties, among others increasing weight of all objects in its close proximity. For a long time, the artefact was a mystery, and it was scientist Sakharov at Yantar who first discovered that Gravi creates a minute singularity field of gravitational nature, the phenomenon which occurs in intervals of 30 minutes. This artefact may yield beneficial results in medicine or warfare if the mechanism behind its functioning is harnessed for the purposes of science. Suffice it to say, its positive properties completely outweigh its negative aspects. Namely, it increases weight of objects as a result of gravitational field and emits lethal doses of radiation. On the other hand, it will protect the user from harmful effects of fire anomalies found throughout the Zone and from acids of chemical/toxic anomalies. However, instead of absorbing deadly chemicals and toxins, Gravi causes chemical compounds to be broken down to simpler substances thanks to its singularity field. As noted above, it is extremely heavy and it is not recommended to use it on long excursions into the Zone, especially for extended periods of time. Radiation output nullified owing to the container.\n \n

As was the case with Gravi, it was scientist Sakharov at Yantar who discovered its unique properties after a massive blowout/emission hit the Zone. Thanks to meticulous research that followed, it was established that this new artefact is produced when three Gravi artefacts interact and get sucked into one another's singularity fields. This phenomenon is extremely rare, due to which the artefact is highly valued. It is rumored within Ukrainian Spetsnaz circles that in the Zone there are agents from the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation whose sole objective is acquiring and transporting Goldfish to specialized laboratories located outside of the Zone. The artefact creates a constant gravitational singularity field which affects only its closest vicinity. However, some stalkers have been known to disappear for no apparent reason leaving only a Goldfish behind. The artefact provides exceptional thermal and acid protection. Furthermore, it also forms a protective and almost greasy film around its user which has qualities of strong fire retardant and also protects the user against acid by breaking down elements comprising acids into simpler substances. It is extremely heavy and it is not recommended to use it on long excursions into the Zone, especially for extended periods of time. Radiation output nullified owing to the container.\n \n

For this reason, one is forced to weigh pros and cons of Crystal when in the vicinity of areas of high toxicity. It also acts as a conductor of electricity. Another positive effect possessed by this artefact is that it accelerates clotting if worn close to the body. (Side note: it is not recommended to keep this artefact in your possession for longer periods of time as blood clots can be hazardous to your health.) This artefact is also highly sought for by jewelers outside the Zone as its inner core is not radioactive and considered to be of exceptional beauty if polished and refined. Only the first 1 cm of its outer layer emits radiation. It is, however, highly advised to proceed with caution when planning to bring the artefact to the market as prolonged exposure to even minimal amounts of radioactive materials can result in death of the user.

This allows it to absorb heat from its vicinity and to create a little pocket around the user which prevents the flames from damaging the body. Stability of temperature is the cause of another of its positive effects: it accelerates healing rate and stops bleeding. It will also protect the user from chemical burns. However, it is unrecommended to approach chemical and acid anomalies when in possession of the artefact as it will increase the adverse effects of acids and toxins in user's bloodstream.

One of their most characteristic features is that they constantly pulsate, generating emissions beneficial to the human body. These emissions increase the metabolism of any living creature, accelerating coagulation and healing of wounds. The mechanism behind the effects of this artefact is still unknown. "Mama's beads" also possess potent protective qualities: they are able to shield the body and objects from extreme heat and acids. On the other hand, it should be noted that the presence of this artefact increases the corrosivity of acids, leading to accelerated deterioration of equipment and higher damage to tissues of any living organism. It is thus strongly advised to proceed with caution in acidic as well as in toxic environments when in possession of "Mama's beads". Another dangerous effect of this artefact is the fact that it will increase electrical conductivity, so the probability of electrocution while wearing this artefact is much higher, especially during storms and in the vicinity of electrical anomalies. The weight is also quite high for such a small artefact, which leads to a conclusion that is of extremely high density. Radiation output nullified owing to the container.\n \n

Experienced stalkers say that Eye also brings luck. Irrespective of the validity of that statement, its positive effects are indeed quite potent. First of all, it reduces temperature of user's body and cools all objects in its vicinity. Secondly, it provides substantial protection against all types of acids by gradually increasing their pH to the level of water (pH of 7). Thirdly, this artefact soothes the pain and is extremely useful when treating wounds. These beneficial qualities, however, come at a price. This artefact is extremely dangerous when exposed to chemical anomalies as it amplifies their toxicity and increases their potency. It is hence highly recommended to keep the artefact in your backpack, never on the body, when exploring toxic areas unless you have a death wish. The artefact is also known colloquially as "Copper eye" as it conducts electricity and amplifies its dangerous effects in the same way as copper does.

It also acts as powerful resistor, and negates the effect of acids. Moreover, its healing capabilities are even stronger than in case of the Eye as stalkers in possession of this artefact are said to have survived being wounded by chimeras. Thanks to that, it has earned the reputation of a miraculous artefact. Many stalkers owe it their lives, and most veteran mutant hunters carry it in case they run into danger. However, it shares not only positive but also negative properties of its cousin: entering a toxic or chemical anomaly with this artefact on the belt is suicide.

Firstly, when in the closest proximity of heat source it emits odor of burning flesh. Prolonged exposure may enhance its flammability and cause it to ignite. While this phenomenon leaves the artefact undamaged, it can cause objects in its vicinity to heat up and in extreme cases to ignite along with the artefact. For this reason, it is safe to conclude that it absorbs heat and is able to convey it to other objects. Secondly, to carry the sponge metaphor further, the pores on its surface are known to absorb small amounts of toxicity from environment. Thirdly, the artefact slightly amplifies the damaging effects of psy-fields to living organisms by absorbing psy energy and emitting it at a small rate. Fourthly, Meat Chunk is also known to be a conductor of electricity much like the skin of a living creature.

Apart from that Bubble, however, possesses numerous negative properties. For example, it greatly amplifies the effects of psy-waves as well as fields produced by mutants and anomalies. This disadvantage is not to be taken lightly: some stalkers have reported that psy influence was so potent when in possession of a Bubble that they felt their heads cracking from the inside and the only thing they could do was scream in pain and run as far as they could. The same mechanism seems to be at work in case of electro anomalies: the artefact will conduct electricity and increase amps of electric current.

This power source is the body itself: the artefact drains vitality and willpower from the user, often on such a scale that it induces dizziness and in extreme cases causes the user to faint. The only other positive aspect to this artefact is the fact that it speeds up healing process and closes up wounds, however it is so potent in this regard that its high price on the market and the demand for it are perfectly justified. Radiation output nullified owing to the container. WARNING: Because of its organic nature and instability this artefact is well known to spontaneously combust more so than any other organic artefact and for this reason it is advised to abstain from wearing it in the vicinity of a fire or acid anomaly.\n \n

Firefly interacts with fields unknown to science, considerably speeding up regeneration of tissue and organs in living beings, as well as normalizing metabolic processes. This artefact can literally get a badly wounded stalker back on his feet in a matter of minutes. On the other hand, Firefly can spontaneously combust when exposed to potent heat sources. It also amplifies the harmful effects of both psy-fields and electro anomalies, and seems to drain stamina and decrease stamina recovery. However, it will absorb any and all deadly chemicals within one's body. Furthermore, it admirably protects against toxicity, and seems to inject neutralizing chemical agents into user's bloodstream, which negate the effects of toxins and nerve damage. For this reason, it is in high demand in military circles as it can make terrorist attacks with chemical or biological weapons more easily manageable. Unfortunately, Firefly is extremely rare.

Thanks to its unique properties, the artefact can significantly increase the bearer's muscle tone, thus greatly improving stamina recovery. Due to its high radioactivity, stalkers in possession of it are sometimes jokingly referred to as "Radioactive Snowflakes". When faced with the decision whether to carry it on the belt during a mission, you have to carefully weigh its pros and cons: does it pay to have greater endurance and high protection against electricity at the cost of being constantly exposed to its deadly radiation? Even if you are determined to take it with you, it should be noted that it is not to be used on long excursions to the Zone. Its usefulness in a fight is also debatable as it increases bleeding rate and prevents wounds from closing due to its very sharp appendages which sting the user and irritate the skin. It is, however, as light as a snowflake and very easy to carry around. Radiation output nullified owing to the container.\n \n
