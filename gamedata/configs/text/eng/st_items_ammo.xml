		<text>Uranium round, chambered in .45 ACP. From the time of the first deployment on the battlefield, depleted uranium rounds have been the object of widespread criticism in the international community; arguments pertaining to their effects on the environment and radiation dust inhaled by the user have been very common in the fight to ban the use of DU. .45 DU uses enforced steel infused with depleted uranium. The round is self-sharpening, which enhances its armor penetrating capabilities. After impact, uranium heats up and burns; this process, however, produces no radiation. These rounds are only actively used by the US, and less effective versions are sometimes employed by other countries.\n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Highest pierced armor class: %c[0,170,170,170]IV\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Tissue damage rating: %c[0,170,170,170]medium - high</text>
