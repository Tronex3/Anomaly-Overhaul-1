		<text>PFM-1 scatterable anti-personnel mine</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_mine_descr">
		<text>PFM-1 (short for противопехотна€ фугасна€ мина; NATO name: "Green parrot") used to be a standard-issue anti-personnel mine of the Red Army, employed mainly during the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Its widespread utilization during the conflict led to high civilian casualties, especially among children, since randomly scattered mines were often mistaken for toys due to their familiar shape and color. For this reason, the PFM-1 earned a sinister nickname: "Child killer." Since then, the mine has been replaced by newer models. However, as was the case with a variety of other 'retired' weaponry, a large number of these mines has somehow made its way into the Zone, becoming its primary booby-trap explosive. The mine is highly valued mainly for its functionality, user-friendliness, compact size and low weight, while its main drawback is a relatively small amount of explosive material: its power is often insufficient to kill a heavily armored stalker with a single blast. For this reason, the mine should be used in combination with other explosive materials and it acts as an igniter. If it is not armed, the mine will not detonate, even when hit with a gun.\n \n

		<text>Improvised explosive device based on OG-7V warhead and parts of a car battery. It looks like it has been carried around for quite some time and could go off any second. Fortunately, the triggering mechanism ensures that it won't unless the explosive is directly hit by a bullet or subjected to other potent physical force. In the Zone, IEDs are quite popular and Zoners use them for a variety of purposes, from gaining access to closed areas to ambushes. They are also often placed next to mines to greatly amplify the power of explosion. IED can be effectively concealed making it virtually invisible to everyone else.\n \n

Upon direct hit, the canister will catch fire and explode after a slight delay. Although heavy and cumbersome, it is extremely powerful, and a well-placed jerrycan can be lethal even if the target wears the heaviest of body armors. On the other hand, the explosion is often so potent that the killer becomes the victim himself, so it's best to use these canisters with caution. There are rumors that a veteran stalker named Yuya once saved his skin by luring a pseudogiant into a jerrycan trap. He emptied his last Makarov magazine and the giant burst into flames with a roar that was heard throughout the Jupiter.\n \n
