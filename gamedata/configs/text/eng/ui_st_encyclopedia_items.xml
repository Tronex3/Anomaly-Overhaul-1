		\nRegarded as a symbol of affluence in the Zone. Most commonly used by the scientists to minimize the harmful effects of artefacts.
		\nDesigned and manufactured in Ukraine by a government institute which provides equipment for the scientists residing in the Zone of Alienation.
		\nIn case of emergency or if no longer needed, the module can be utilized as a source of quality metal for use in outfit or helmet repairs. 
		\n \nTo attach it to the belt, you have to put an artefact inside. The artefact will retain its characteristics with the exception of reduced radiation output.
